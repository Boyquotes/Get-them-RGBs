# Get them RGBs!
A simple game/project made in GODOT 4.0 for the purpose of playing, learning, and getting familiar with GODOT 4.0.

The game is about you, the player, touching the colored circles that match your color while being chased by the enemy circle.
And you are a circle as well.

If you happen to play this game, then please forgive me for the game sounds.
They are atrocious abominations that I've made in Audacity in a short period of time just so that the game has some sounds.
